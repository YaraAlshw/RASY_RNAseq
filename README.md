# RASY_RNAseq

This repository contains all the scripts used to analyze RNAseq data, conduct differential gene epression analysis, and GO enrichment analysis in Alshwairikh & Skelly 2025 (in prep). [Link will be provided upon publicatiin]. This reporsitory is archived on Dryad [insert link upon archiving]

Script to analyze RNAseq data was adopted from <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2024.101296">Vaziri et al. 2024</a></p>

Raw RNAseq data is available on NCBI under BioProject ID PRJNA1247543.
